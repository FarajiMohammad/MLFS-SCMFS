Abstract :
Multi-label feature selection plays an indispensable role in multi-label learning, which eliminates irrele- vant and redundant features while retaining relevant features. Most of existing multi-label feature selec- tion methods employ two strategies to construct feature selection models: extracting label correlations to guide feature selection process and maintaining the consistency between the feature matrix and the reduced low-dimensional feature matrix. However, the data information is described by two data matri- ces: the feature matrix and the label matrix. Previous methods devote attention to either of the two data matrices. To address this issue, we propose a novel feature selection method named Feature Selection considering Shared Common Mode between features and labels (SCMFS). First, we utilize Coupled Ma- trix Factorization (CMF) to extract the shared common mode between the feature matrix and the label matrix, considering the comprehensive data information in the two matrices. Additionally, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is adopted to enhance the interpretability for feature selection. Extensive ex- periments are implemented on fifteen real-world benchmark data sets for multiple evaluation metrics, the experimental results demonstrate the classification superiority of the proposed method.
